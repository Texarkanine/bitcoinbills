Bitcoin Bills
=====

A fork of [Canton Becker's Bitcoin Paper Wallet](https://github.com/cantonbecker/bitcoinpaperwallet)

Tunes & updates the original, safe generator (pre April 2018) specifically for "Bitcoin Bills:"
paper wallets that will be pre-generated in fixed quantities & given away at unknown future dates to unknown parties.

1. Removes coins other than Bitcoin
2. Removes references & links to bitcoinpaperwallet[.]com
3. Adds cautionary text around how to use paper wallets (only sweep - never deposit!)

DO NOT USE Online Wallet Generators
=====

* BITCOINPAPERWALLET[.]COM is a scam that steals your bitcoin.
* BITCOINPAPERWALLER[.]IO is a scam that steals your bitcoin.

***  DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE BITCOINPAPERWALLET[.]COM  ***
*********************************************************
Since I transferred ownership of this domain in 2018,
it has been reported that funds secured using wallets
generated on the live site were stolen. (Malicious code
was inserted to generate predictable random keys.)

As far as I know, wallets that were properly generated by
downloading this code from GitHub (at any time, including
after 2018) are not at risk. However, wallets that were
generated on the live website after April 2018 should be
considered as untrustworthy.

First of all, thanks to everyone who supported this project and helped with its development since I started it back in 2013. 
 
At the end of April 2018, I sold the bitcoinpaperwallet.com website, service, and associated domain names to a new owner.  This also includes related projects such as litecoinpaperwallet.com and ethereumpaperwallet.com.  All orders for hologram stickers and CDs, and any questions relating to the business, should be directed to the new owner at orders@paperwalletshop.com.  Also, I will no longer be making updates or accepting code contributions for this project at https://github.com/cantonbecker/bitcoinpaperwallet. The updates posted in September 2017 are my final contributions to this project.
 
If you have any questions regarding bitcoinpaperwallet.com, please direct them to the new owner at orders@paperwalletshop.com.
